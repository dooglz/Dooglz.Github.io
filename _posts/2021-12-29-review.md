All content here is fiction, additionally it does not equal any endorsement. Recommendations are purely hypothetical and not indicative of my opinions and reality. 



2021 has all in all been a good year for me. It's pandemic year so they don't get scored in the same way.


I've learned to care less about the follies of humans, and appreciate more the things immediately here and now. 
"When life gives you lemons, you don't have to give a shit."


Anyway... Who doesn't love lists, let's list things I noted in 2021.

# Video Games

# In Review



The message from 2021 I want to leave you with is, Hope and Frustration.
Consider everything; It doesn't have to be like this. We can all do better. 


Honesty.


The game is rigged form the start, the house always wins, but I'm sick of us all pretending like that's how it's gotta be. 


We need to do better. For all of us now, and for all of us still to come.
The good news is we have unlimited opportunities to do better, and so we should also have a little fun along the way.

Here's to 2022, And to us.

One Love.
